write a program to check the eligibility of a person to apply for g1, g2 and g based on age, 
citizenship status, driving license from other country and experience of driving in months using if conditions.

work permit (65 months driving experience india) 
yes have license in india

age int or double
citizen status defined string pr immigrant citizen
driving leicen other country yes or no char
drving experience int or double



Question 2 

write a program to print numbers divisble by 3 and 7 using loops where the
starting number and the ending number range is given by the user.

Question  3

write a program to generate factorial of a given number 


question 4

write a program to generate the sum of even numbers and sum of odd numbers from a given range 

question 5 

create a multiplication table of a given number using loops


question 6

write a program where user enters a whole number and compares to every number in a range provided by the user and prints
 out a boolean for each of the following cases in a table:

GreaterThan
LessThan
Equal
Greater Thsan or Equal to 
Less Than or equal to
Not equal

however if the product ofboth num  is divisible by 3
print out fizz in all the places 

if product of number and i is divisible by 7 print out buzz 
if divisible by both print out fizz buzz


question 7

given a number, check if each digit in that number is either 3 or 7 and print "yes" if it is, "No" otherwise

example:

3773
3333333
7


question 8
given two numbers, check if they're equal without using an if statement

3,4 --> False
3,3 --> True

print boolean for each of the following pieces


question 9:

making sandwich
base price = $2

user has options what thehy wannt to add :

1- onion
2- tomato
3- chicken
4- beef
5- mayo

once they are done their options, if they have:

onion and letture  - add $2
beef or chicken - add $3
no mayo subtract $1

find out how many sandwiches they want 
give the final cost of their meal

Question 11:
prompt the user for an odd number(x),

then print out a sequence that starts with 1 and then follows the pattern 'odd,even,odd,even' 
in ascending order until your sequence contains(x) numbers, use any type of loop

eg. if given the number 5, the sequence to be printed is 1,3,2,5,4


Question 12:
the output of the program will be followed as given below:

	please choose one of the below options:
	1: basic arithmatic operations
	2: computational operations
	3: exit

if option 1: 
	1:addtion
	2:multiplication
	3:division
	4:go back
	5:exit fully

if option 2:
	1:the factorial of a number (1 input)
	2:find power (2 inputs)
	3:find average of the given range (2 inputs)
	4:go back 
	5:exit fully

NOTE:The options have to be looped continuosly until the user chooses to exit

CONDITIONS: 
	1:Calculator main class should only contain a switch case
	2:Calculator logic will contain all the methods with their respective logic


Question 12:
Create an employee controller class, employee logic class, employee class where main method will be in controller class. 
variables declared in emplyee class
logical methods are declared in emplyee logic class
the variables in the employee class are:
	1:emp id
	2:emp name
	3:emp salary
and initialed in the constructor making the variables private

Add 2 employees taking input dynamically and print the employee informatrion in the console.

COMMON NOTE: All input needs to be validated
