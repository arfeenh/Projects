create class myFirstClass 
create 3 variables of type integer, double, String in which string is static variable 
and remaining 2 are instance variables

print all 3 values from main method.

create a method in the same class m1 with no parameters and print all 3 values
local variable int i=600;


and create another method m2 
create local variable int i=500;
print it


question 2: 

create class mySecondClass 
print values of 3 variables defined in myFirstClass in main
create a non static method m1 no parameters
print values of 3 varaibles from myFirstClass

question 3:
write a program which will concatenate the values to print your full name by taking input from the user dynamically 
in the following way,
enter first name: ayush
enter last name: bhatt

your full name is ayush bhatt.

note the logic is written in a different method
the input is taken from the main method
use scanner class to take input dynamically

question 4:

4 functions
